# Online Voting DApp

## Introduction

This is a decentralized application (DApp) for conducting online voting using the Ethereum blockchain. The DApp allows users to connect their Ethereum wallet, vote for their preferred candidate, and view the results, including the winner of the election.

## Features

- Connect your Ethereum wallet (MetaMask) to the DApp.
- Choose a candidate and cast your vote.
- View the list of candidates and their respective vote counts.
- Close the voting process when it's finished.
- Determine the winner of the election.

## Prerequisites

Before using this DApp, ensure you have the following:

1. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/): A browser extension to manage your Ethereum wallet.
2. An Ethereum account with some Ether (ETH) for transaction fees.
3. A deployed smart contract for online voting. You will need the contract address and ABI.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Click the "Connect Wallet" button to connect your MetaMask wallet.
2. Select your preferred candidate from the dropdown menu and click the "Vote" button to cast your vote.
3. View the list of candidates and their vote counts in the "Results" section.
4. Once the voting is complete, click the "Close Voting" button to close the voting process.
5. Click the "Get Winner" button to determine the winner of the election.

## Customization

- Replace the candidate names in the JavaScript code with your specific candidates.
- Ensure the contract address and ABI in the JavaScript code match your deployed voting smart contract.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter issues connecting your wallet, ensure MetaMask is installed and unlocked.
- Make sure you use an account with the privilege to close the voting process before clicking the "Close Voting" button.
